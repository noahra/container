I am currently on step 2 with this challenge.

What is left now is to

1. Read about UTS namespaces in Linux.
2. Read about processes, and child processes, hostnames and NIS domains.
3. Implement such that running a command will do it in a different hostname
4. which forces me to learn about clone() system call in Linux
